  <p>
    I am a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University (OSU), where I am advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sachinkumar">Dr. Sachin Kumar</a>. Before joining OSU, I conducted research at Academia Sinica with <a href="http://cfda.csie.org/~cjwang/">Dr. Chuan-Ju Wang</a> and completed my undergraduate studies at National Chengchi University under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/~mftsai/">Prof. Ming-Feng Tsai</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research lies in natural language processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR)  and large language models (LLMs), with a focus on improving their efficiency, reliability, and deployment in real-world applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I am exploring techniques for multitoken prediction and tokenizer design. In parallel, I develop robust evaluation benchmarks for the medical domain. My work involves close collaboration with hospitals to ensure that these models are not only effective, but also trustworthy and practically deployable in real-world clinical settings.
